# Vasculature

Generation of realistic 3D vasculature within a bounded mesh, mimicking natural growth. As far as I know, this has not been done to this level of realism. Works with multiple networks. 

Created in Unity3D using C#. Some prototyping with Python in Blender.

Designed for straightforward use and broad applicability, with clear step-by-step instructions and documentation. 

My largest project to date @ > 10,000 lines of code written over several months.
